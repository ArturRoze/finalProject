0. Comments 1.-6. are valid for whole project.

1. Please, use clean code practices

2. In Main.main I see:
MainMenu mainMenu = new MainMenu();            
mainMenu.startGame();

If object is used at once, you do not need create separated variable for this object. So we can write:
new MainMenu().startGame();

3. In Main.main I see:
catch (Exception e) {            
e.printStackTrace();        
}

e.printStackTrace(); in catch is not informative, it would be better to write failure explanation, for example:
System.out.println("Error with starting main menu");

4. In Main.main I see:
catch (Exception e) {
It would be better to write more specific exception class

5. Always write at the left side interface/abstract class, for example:
List<Person> persons = new ArrayList<>();

6. All void comments should be removed, for example:
/** * */

7. boolean removeBookRoom(Room room);
I think better name method is:
cancelBookRoom

8. Why interface HotelService is empty?

9.  boolean unBookUser(Room aRoom);
I think better name method is:
cancelBookRoomByUser
or unbookRoomByUser

10. boolean bookUser(Room aRoom, User user);
I think better name method is:
bookRoomByUser

11.
